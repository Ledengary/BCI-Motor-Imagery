Classifying body movements from motor imagery brain signals

In this project, I have experimented with the [BCI Competition IV Dataset](http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/) to classify body movements. Additionally, Machine Learning algorithms have been applied on data that has previously been filtered using the Common Spatial Pattern technique (+ Frequency Based CSP) which effectively differentiates signals of different labels, making it easier for Machine Learning algorithms to classify them.
